🚁 Gesture Drone Control System
📌 Project Overview
The Gesture Drone Control System is an AI-based project that allows users to control a drone using hand gestures instead of traditional remote controllers. The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize gestures in real time and convert them into drone commands.
This project demonstrates the practical use of AI, ML, and image processing in human–computer interaction.

🎯 Objectives
To control a drone using hand gestures
To eliminate the need for physical controllers
To improve intuitive and contactless drone navigation
To apply AI/ML concepts in a real-world system

🧠 Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV – for image processing
MediaPipe – for hand landmark detection
NumPy – for numerical computations
Machine Learning – gesture classification
Drone SDK / Simulation (if applicable)

✋ Gestures and Actions
Gesture        Action
Open Palm      Hover
Fist           Land
Hand Up        Move Up
Hand Down      Move Down
Left Gesture   Move Left
Right Gesture  Move Right
(Gestures can be customized based on implementation)

⚙️ System Architecture
Camera captures hand movements
OpenCV processes the video frames
MediaPipe detects hand landmarks
ML model classifies gestures
Commands are sent to the drone
